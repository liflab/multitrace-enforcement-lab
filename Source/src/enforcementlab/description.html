<p>This is an instance of the <a href="https://liflab.github.io/labpal">LabPal</a>
experimental environment. It contains experiments aimed at measuring the overhead
of a <a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep</a> processor pipeline
to perform runtime enforcement of security policies using the concept of
"multi-trace".</p>
